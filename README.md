# Internet Programming
Another repository that holds all my other files for the "Internet Programming" course, including assignments.

## Why another repository?
---------------------
Didn't want to rename my original repository ("internet-programming-assignment-1"), so I decided to just create another one; I was concerned with complications that might arise if I do rename my repo, plus I did not want to update all of my remote URLs, even though the process to do that is *simple*.
